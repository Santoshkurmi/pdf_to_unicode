PDF Text Extractor

In many Nepali PDFs or other pdf that use Unicode fonts, copying text often results in incorrect or unreadable characters. This can also happen when PDFs intentionally scramble text output for security purposes. To address this, Iâ€™ve created a Python script that enables users to extract and copy the correct text from such PDFs by manually mapping glyphs to Unicode characters.
Features

    Manual Glyph Mapping:
    Map custom glyphs from the PDF to their corresponding Unicode values.
    Accurate Text Extraction:
    Extract readable Nepali text from PDFs with scrambled or non-standard text rendering.
    Flexible and Customizable:
    Modify the mappings to support other fonts or languages if required.
